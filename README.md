# Palindrome Number and Reverse String Java Examples

This repository contains basic Java code examples for checking palindrome numbers and reversing strings. Palindrome numbers are numbers that remain the same when their digits are reversed, while reversing a string involves reversing the order of characters within the string.

## Code Examples

### Palindrome Number

- [PalindromeNumber.java](src/basics/PalindromeNumber.java): This program checks whether a given integer is a palindrome number or not.

### Reverse String

- [ReverseString.java](src/basics/ReverseString.java): This program demonstrates how to reverse a given string.
